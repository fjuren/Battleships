# Battleships

## Purpose:

Battleships is a mini project that I built as part of my self-taught journey toward becoming a web developer. The primary purpose of this project was to build an understanding of basic unit testing using Jest, but also to let me practice vanilla Javascript before learning JS libraries. This project was also to help me better understand webpack and ESlint.

Two things I tried to do during this project was to 1) reuse functionality where ever I could and to 2) ensure each function had only one job to do with appropriate helper functions.

An improvement I might add to a next iteration is to build a better computer algorithm, making the game more challenging and fun. Building this algorithm isn't in line wiht my personal roadmap toward web development, but I intend to come back to this when I'm looking for a different kind of challenge!


## Game Features:

- One player game against a computer (current version of the game uses a basic algorithm for movement. Opportunity for improvement)
- Dynamic web-based rendering as player progresses through the game
- Applied some UX thinking for intuitive interaction
