Steps below in index.js. This is game flow functionality
[ ] Create players in index.js
[ ] Create gameboards per player in index.js
[ ] Populate each gameboard with ship positions (random for now)
[ ] Take player moves by clicking on board coords 
[ ] // take user click specific coordinates
[ ] // render moves and hit/miss
[ ] Contine turn by turn moves, informing user what happened each move and what 
hit/missed
[ ] // if you're missing methods, figure out where a new one belongs
[ ] Inform users when game over happens and who won
[ ] Figure out how you want players to place their ships
